    "\n",
    "- Refresh you knowledge of probability theory including properties of random variables, probability density functions,  cumulative distribution functions, and key statistics such as mean and variance.\n",
    "- Revisit common linear algebra and matrix operations and concepts such as matrix multiplication, inner and outer products, inverses, the Hadamard (element-wise) product, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, and symmetry.\n",
    "- Practice numerical programming, core to machine learning, by loading and filtering data, plotting data, vectorizing operations, profiling code speed, and debugging and optimizing performance. You will also practice computing probabilities based on simulation.\n",
    "- Develop or refresh your knowledge of Git version control, which will be a core tool used in the final project of this course\n",
    "- Apply your skills altogether through an exploratory data analysis to practice data cleaning, data manipulation, interpretation, and communication \n",

    "**[6 points]** *Vectorization*. When we first learn to code and think about iterating over an array, we often use loops. If implemented correctly, that does the trick. In machine learning, we iterate over so much data that those loops can lead to significant slow downs if they are not computationally efficient. In Python, vectorizing code and relying on matrix operations with efficient tools like numpy is typically the faster approach. Of course, numpy relies on loops to complete the computation, but this is at a lower level of programming (typically in C), and therefore is much more efficient. This exercise will explore the benefits of vectorization. Since many machine learning techniques rely on matrix operations, it's helpful to begin thinking about implementing algorithms using vector forms.\n",

    "Begin by creating an array of 10 million random numbers using the numpy `random.randn` module. Compute the sum of the squares of those random numbers first in a for loop, then using Numpy's `dot` module to perform an inner (dot) product. Verify that your code produces the same output in each case. Time how long it takes to compute each and report the results and report the output. How many times faster is the vectorized code than the for loop approach? (Note - your results may vary from run to run).\n",

    "**[15 points]** Here you'll bring together some of the individual skills that you demonstrated above and create a Jupyter notebook based blog post on your exploratory data analysis. Your goal is to identify a question or problem and to work towards solving it or providing additional information or evidence (data) related to it through your data analysis. Below, we walk through a process to follow for your analysis. Additionally, you can find an [example of a well-done exploratory data analysis here from past years](https://github.com/kylebradbury/ids705/blob/master/assignments/Assignment_1_Q12_Example.ipynb).\n",

    "3. Check the data and see if they need to be cleaned: are there missing values? Are there clearly erroneous values? Do two tables need to be merged together? Clean the data so it can be visualized. If the data are clean, state how you know they are clean (what did you check?).\n",
    "3. Plot the data, demonstrating interesting features that you discover. Are there any relationships between variables that were surprising or patterns that emerged? Please exercise creativity and curiosity in your plots. You should have at least 4 plots exploring the data in different ways.\n",
    "4. What insights are you able to take away from exploring the data? Is there a reason why analyzing the dataset you chose is particularly interesting or important? Summarize this for a general audience (imagine your publishing a blog post online) - boil down your findings in a way that is accessible, but still accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here your analysis will evaluated based on:\n",
    "1. Motivation: was the purpose of the choice of data clearly articulated? Why was the dataset chosen and what was the goal of the analysis?\n",
    "2. Data cleaning: were any issues with the data investigated and, if found, were they resolved?\n",
    "3. Quality of data exploration: were at least 4 unique plots (minimum) included and did those plots demonstrate interesting aspects of the data? Was there a clear purpose and takeaway from EACH plot? \n",
    "4. Interpretation: Were the insights revealed through the analysis and their potential implications clearly explained? Was there an overall conclusion to the analysis?"

    "> Mexico City subway network connects the fifth largest city in the world with 21 million habitants and as such,  is essential for people's commutes to work, school, and daily activities. Having a large amount of users, the subway needs to be on prime condition to operate efficienty and on time. The dataset for this EDA gives us information on the daily users by line and station, which can be used to identify the most used stations by entrypoint and date, as well as the growth of users by year or month. All of this insights provide government and users information about the stations that could need more maintance as they have more users and can also give insights about the current rate of users related to the subway capcity. The latter can assist urban developers. \n",

It measures daily influx of users in the Mexico City's metro from January 2021 to December 2023, the data presents information of the daily influx by station and type of payment.

    "I was born and raised in Mexico City, and my reliance on the public transportation system stems from two reasons: firstly, my aversion to driving, and secondly, the abysmal state of car transit, making the subway a quicker alternative. However, my experiences with the metro have been marked by a noticeable lack of maintenance and severe overcrowding. Furthermore, the newest metro line was recently closed for an entire year due to construction issues, which led to a tragic incident that claimed 27 lives. Recognizing the variations in metro usage across stations and lines is crucial for both authorities and citizens, providing valuable insights for service improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the city's transport authority strives to publish user-related information, there's an omission regarding infrastructure details. Information on trains only encompasses the total count per line, neglecting aspects such as train size, capacity, years in usage, or days in service. These limitations hinder accountability, but even with the available data, intriguing insights can be gleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in Graph 1, the yearly growth in total users highlights consistently high usage on lines 2, 3, 9, and 8. Graph 2 reveals a notable shift towards the preference for prepaid cards over tickets in the past three years, with an unexpected decline in single ticket usage in the last trimester of 2023. This decline warrants further exploration to comprehend its origin and its implications for both citizens and the transportation authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs 3 and 4 unveil the most frequented stations, providing authorities with valuable information to allocate resources for maintenance. Additionally, by categorizing stations as terminal, intermediate, or transfer, it becomes possible to gauge the maintenance needs and the ramifications of potential closures for service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concluding graph illustrates the average daily users per metro line and the corresponding number of operating trains. Notably, heavily-used lines 2, 3, 8, and 9 don't necessarily have the highest train counts. This raises  questions for further exploration. Why do more congested lines have fewer trains than less congested ones? Is this linked to train type or capacity? What is the average passenger load compared to capacity?\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploratory data analysis of daily users in Mexico City's subway system is a significant step towards comprehending its usage patterns. It serves as an accountability tool, urging authorities to allocate resources for enhancement and maintenance. Regrettably, the data currently available is insufficient to gauge the system's response to demand, as crucial information on the state of trains, stations, and service remains elusive.\n",
